Please propose a task for testing the boundary of executability of the skill [SKILL] regarding a predicate [PRED].
Here is the list of actions you can use for the task: [ACTION_LIST].
We aims to find the boundary, so if the task is completed succesfully, make it harder next time, otherwise make it easier.
Also, you should make the tasks to be diverse, probably by trying low-level motions a lot.
