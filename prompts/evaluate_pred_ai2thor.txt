A robot is executing a skill `[GROUNDED_SKILL]`. Given the following egocentric observation from the robot, what is the truth value of the predicate `[GROUNDED_PRED]`? Answer with reasoning and True or False in a separate line. Note that the blue sphere on the gripper is a part of the gripper and is not an object,  and it's in a simulated environment so you can only tell that the object is grasped if it's lifted from the original surface by the gripper, and if the object is lifted it means the robot's hand is holding the object, vice versa. Also, do not assume the object is in the scene.
