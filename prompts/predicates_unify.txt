There are different sets of predicates designed for different skills, but some of them could be overlapped. Your task is to unifiy the predicates by mapping different predicate names with same semantic or same function together. Strictly follow this format below:

Input:

Skill: Open
Predicates: CloseToObject(robot, object), ObjectOpenable(object) ObjectIsClosed(object)

Skill: Close
Predicates: ObjectIsOpen(object), ObjectIsGrasped(robot, object), NearObject(robot, object)

Skill: Find
Predicates: CloseTo(robot, object), LookingAt(robot, object)

Equivalent Predicates:

- CloseToObject(robot, object) | NearObject(robot, object) | CloseTo(robot, object)

- ObjectIsClosed(object) | ObjectIsOpen(object)

Input:
