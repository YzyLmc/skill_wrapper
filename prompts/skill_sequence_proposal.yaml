  A robot with a single gripper is attempting to learn the preconditions and effects 
  for a finite set of skills by executing exploratory skill sequences and exploring the environment.

prompt: |
  Propose a set of skill sequences for a robot to execute.
  The robot is attempting to learn the preconditions and effects for a finite set of operators. 
  The robot can navigate the environment freely but only has one gripper. 
  The robot has access to the following skills with their associated arguments:

  [SKILL_PROMPT]
  
  The list of objects the robot has previously encountered in the environment are: 
  [OBJECT_IN_SCENE]
  [ENV_DESCRIPTION]

  The pairs of consecutive skills (skill1, skill2) that have been least explored are: 
  [[LEAST_EXPLORED_SKILLS]].

  Certain skills have similar names and arguments, but different preconditions and effects. 
  Using the list of objects and the skill preconditions / effects learned, 
  generate 5 tasks and their sequence of skills such that: 
  (1) the tasks purposefully violate skill preconditions often 
  (2) the ordering of skills in each task is unique 
  (3) at least 1 unexplored skill pair is used in each task 
  (4) all tasks have at least 8 skills in sequence.

  Output only the task name and the sequence of skills to execute, 
  ensuring to follow the naming/syntax/arguments for skills provided. 
  Output 1 skill every new line, following the format below:
  Skill Sequence 1: 
  GoTo(CounterTop)
  PickUp(Apple, CounterTop)
  
  Skill Sequence 2:
