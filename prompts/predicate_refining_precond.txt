A robot has been programmed with the skill `[LIFTED_SKILL]` two times, and the first execution of `[GROUNDED_SKILL_1]` [SUCCESS_1] while the second execution of `[GROUNDED_SKILL_2]` [SUCCESS_2], which indicates the existing predicate set is not sufficient to describe the precondition of the skill.
Your task is to propose a high-level and generalized predicate and the semantic meaning of the predicate given the images before two executions. The predicates should contain 0~2 parameters ('robot' must be included as a parameter if the predicate is about the relationship between the robot and the environment, and empty parenthesis is allowed), and it should describe important aspects of the skill, such as the spatial relationship between different arguments of the skill, and physical constraints (whether the robot has empty hands, whether it's close enough to or far away from the target), but not any low-level predicates that involve path clearance, obstruction detection, nor obstacle checking to check accessibility or reachability, since we don't have measure of those.
Example format:
`example_predicate`: example_semantic_meaning.
Current predicate set: 
`[PRED_LIST]`
(it means no predicate has been proposed if the list above is empty)
You should only use the parameters of the skills if the new predicate is parametrized. Also, you should avoid similar predicates that are already in the current predicate set, and you shouldn't talk about skill executions when defining the semantic of predicates since predicate is a description of the world state.
Tried predicates:
`[TRIED_PRED]`
New predicate regarding the precondition of the skill `[LIFTED_SKILL]`:
