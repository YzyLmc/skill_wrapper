A robot is executing tasks in a household environment. Given the following visual observation of the environment and egocentric observation from the robot (you can see the robot's gripper from its egocentric observation), what is the truth value of the predicate `[PRED]`? Answer with reasoning and True or False in a separate line. Note that this is in a simulated environment so you can only tell that the object is grasped if it's lifted from the original surface by the gripper, and if the object is lifted it means the robot's hand is holding the object, vice versa. Also, do not assume the object is in the scene.
`[PRED]`: [SEMANTIC]
