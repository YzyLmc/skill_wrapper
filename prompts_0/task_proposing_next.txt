Your task is to propose tasks to find the set of world states where the skill is executable. The proposed task should target to test the provided predicate. For example, if the skill is 'Open(object)' and the predicate is 'IsClosed(object)', you should first try to open an object when it's closed, and if the task succeeds, try to open it after the object is already opened and observe the successfulness of the task.
We aim to find the boundary of skill executability, so if the previous task is completed successfully, make it harder next time, otherwise make it easier.
Also, you should make the tasks diverse, and one way is to try low-level actions right before the target skill [SKILL]. Note that: 1. introducing more actions adds more complexity than swapping objects with same set of actions. 2. All low-level actions can be called at anytime.

Environmental description: [BASIC_INFO]
High-level action list: [HIGHLV_ACTION_LIST]
Low-level action list: [LOWLV_ACTION_LIST]
Variables for high-level actions: Book, KeyChain, CellPhone, Couch, Table
Your task is to propose tasks for the skill [SKILL] regarding the predicate [PRED].
Now, you are asked to propose a new task based on the previous tasks you have proposed and adjust the task difficulty according to the success of previous task executions.
